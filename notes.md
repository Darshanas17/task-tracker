### Database Choice: SQLite

I chose **SQLite** because it’s simple, needs no setup, and keeps all data in one file. It’s fast and perfect for small projects like this.

### Design Decisions

Each task has a title, description, priority, and status. I added checks to allow only valid values and used timestamps to track when tasks are created or updated.
